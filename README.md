# Go_Moon

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
Wondered how human could book a seat in the space ship as they travel to the moon
or even other planets.
I decided to create a flutter project that could facilitate booking for you!

You can choose your preffered station, number of passengers and the class of travel you may want to use.

ENJOY!!!
